#### Option: `function`

1. console.log(typeof fn);: This line is executed first. At this point, foo is hoisted as a variable, but it has not been assigned a value yet, so its type is undefined.

2. function fn() { return "reassign" }: The function declaration is hoisted to the top of its containing scope (in this case, the entire script or function). This means that the foo variable is now a function.

3. var fn = "reassign";: This line is executed last. It reassigns the variable fn with the string value "reassign" overwriting the previous function declaration.

So, when you call console.log(typeof fn); after the entire script has been executed, the output will be "function" because, at the time of the console.log statement, fn refers to the function declaration that was hoisted.

#### Option: `function`

function fn() { return "reassign"; }: This is a function declaration, and it creates a function named fn. Function declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing scope.

var fn; This declares a variable foo. However, since there's already a function declaration named foo in the same scope, the variable declaration doesn't override the function declaration.
