#### ‚ûº‚ûº‚ûº: `function`

1. console.log(typeof fn);: This line is executed first. At this point, foo is hoisted as a variable, but it has not been assigned a value yet, so its type is undefined.

2. function fn() { return "reassign" }: The function declaration is hoisted to the top of its containing scope (in this case, the entire script or function). This means that the foo variable is now a function.

3. var fn = "reassign";: This line is executed last. It reassigns the variable fn with the string value "reassign" overwriting the previous function declaration.

So, when you call console.log(typeof fn); after the entire script has been executed, the output will be "function" because, at the time of the console.log statement, fn refers to the function declaration that was hoisted.

#### ‚ûº‚ûº‚ûº: `function`

function fn() { return "reassign"; }: This is a function declaration, and it creates a function named fn. Function declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing scope.

var fn; This declares a variable foo. However, since there's already a function declaration named foo in the same scope, the variable declaration doesn't override the function declaration.

#### ‚ûº‚ûº‚ûº: "bar"

This ```JS code defines two functions: outer and inner. When you run outer(), it calls inner(), logs "bar" to the console, and exits the outer function. The return statement doesn't affect the output. The final result is that "bar" is printed to the console when the script is executed.

#### ‚ûº‚ûº‚ûº:1

In this code snippet, there's a conditional block, but due to function hoisting, both branches define a function named fn. Regardless of the condition, the function defined inside the if block is the one that gets hoisted and is accessible outside the block. Consequently, when fn() is called outside the conditional block, it prints "1" to the console. The condition itself (if true or false) doesn't affect the output.

#### ‚ûº‚ûº‚ûº: foo


The code defines a function foo that takes a function x as a parameter. Inside foo, it immediately calls x(), and then declares a nested function x that logs "foo" to the console.

When foo is invoked with an anonymous function logging "bar," due to hoisting, the nested x inside foo is called first, logging "foo," and then the anonymous function is invoked, logging "bar."

#### ‚ûº‚ûº‚ûº: 3


The given code will output: 3
Here's the explanation:

Function declarations are hoisted to the top during the compilation phase. So, when the code is executed:

```JS
function foo() {
  console.log(1);
}
```
The first function declaration function foo() is hoisted to the top, and it logs 1 to the console.

Next, there is a variable declaration using var:

```JS
var foo = function () {
  console.log(2);
};
```
This declaration is also hoisted to the top, but it doesn't override the previous function declaration. At this point, foo still refers to the function declared in step 1.

Another function declaration follows:

```JS
function foo() {
  console.log(3);
}
```
Again, this function declaration is hoisted to the top. It overrides the previous function declaration and sets foo to the new function that logs 3 to the console.

When foo() is called:

```JS
foo();
```
It executes the latest function assigned to foo, which logs 3 to the console.

7. **What will be the output ?**

```JS
   function animal() {
    console.log("Cat");

  var otherAnimal;
  animal();
  otherAnimal();
  otherAnimal = function () {
    console.log("Dog");
  };

```

<br/>

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### ‚ûº‚ûº‚ûº: error

```JS
function animal() {
    console.log("Cat");
}

var otherAnimal; // Variable declaration (undefined)

animal(); // Function invocation - Outputs: Cat

otherAnimal(); // Error: otherAnimal is not a function

otherAnimal = function () {
    console.log("Dog");
};
```

In this code, an attempt to invoke otherAnimal before its initialization as a function will result in an error. The error occurs because otherAnimal is assigned a function expression after the attempted invocation.

#### ‚ûº‚ûº‚ûº: ∆í b() {} 6


Function Expression Assignment:

```JS

b = function a() {};

```
Declares a function expression a and assigns it to the variable b.

Variable Declaration and Assignment:

```JS

var a = (b = 6);
```
Assigns the value 6 to b and assigns the result (which is 6) to a.

Function Expression Assignment:

```JS

a = function b() {};
```
Declares a function expression b and assigns it to a.

Function Declarations (hoisted):

```JS

function b() {}
function a() {}
```
Hoisted function declarations for b and a.

Logging the Variables:

```JS

console.log(a, b);
```
Outputs the values, resulting in:

```JS

function b() 6
```
In summary, the code involves variable reassignments, function expressions, and hoisted function declarations. The console.log statement shows the final values of a (function expression) and b (assigned number).

9. **What will be the output ?**

```JS
  var a = 10;
console.log("line number 2", a);
function fn() {
  console.log("line number 4", a);
  var a = 20;
  a++;
  console.log("line number 7", a);
  if (a) {
    var a = 30;
    a++;
    console.log("line number 11", a);
  }
  console.log("line number 13", a);
}
fn();
```

<br/>

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### ‚ûº‚ûº‚ûº:
line number 4 undefined
line number 7 21
line number 11 31
line number 13 31

Certainly! Let's break down the code step by step and see what gets printed to the console:

```JS

var a = 10;
console.log("line number 2", a);
Output: line number 2 10
```

Here, a variable a is declared and assigned the value 10. The value of a is then logged to the console.

```JS

function fn() {
  console.log("line number 4", a);
  var a = 20;
  a++;
  console.log("line number 7", a);
  if (a) {
    var a = 30;
    a++;
    console.log("line number 11", a);
  }
  console.log("line number 13", a);
}
fn();
```
Output:

```JS

line number 4 undefined
line number 7 21
line number 11 31
line number 13 31
```
Inside the function fn, a new variable a is declared and assigned the value 20, but the logging of the variable at "line number 4" prints undefined because there is a variable shadowing effect. The inner variable a is hoisted to the top of the function, so at the point of logging, it exists but hasn't been assigned a value yet.

The value of a is then incremented and logged at "line number 7". Inside the if statement, a new variable a is declared and assigned the value 30, incremented, and logged at "line number 11". After exiting the if statement, the value of a is logged again at "line number 13".

So, the final output shows the values of a at different points inside the function. The variable a inside the function does affect the outer a due to the hoisting and variable shadowing.

10. **What will be the output ?**

```JS
function foo() {
  let a = (b = 0);
  a++;
  return a;
}
foo();
console.log(typeof a);
console.log(typeof b);

```

<br/>

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### ‚ûº‚ûº‚ûº:undefined,number

Inside the function foo, there is a variable a declared using let, and it is assigned the value (b = 0). Here, the expression (b = 0) assigns 0 to both variable b and variable a. The parentheses are used to avoid any potential issues with the assignment.

a is then incremented by 1 with a++, and the function returns the updated value of a.

When the function foo is invoked with foo();, it doesn't explicitly use the returned value, so the result (the incremented value of a) is not logged or stored anywhere.

After the function call, there are two console.log statements:

console.log(typeof a);: This attempts to log the type of the variable a outside the function. However, since a is declared with let inside the function, it has block scope and is not accessible outside the function. As a result, this line will throw an error, and the script execution may stop at this point.
console.log(typeof b);: This attempts to log the type of the variable b outside the function. Surprisingly, b is not declared with let or var inside the function, making it implicitly a global variable. As a result, this line will log the type of b, which is number.
In summary, the code will likely throw an error at the first console.log statement (typeof a) due to the block-scoping of a. The second console.log statement (typeof b) will log number, as b becomes a global variable due to the absence of a declaration keyword (let, var, or const) inside the function.

11. **What will be the output ?**

```JS
let a = {};
let b = { key: "b" };
let c = { key: "c" };

a[b] = 123;
a[c] = 456;

console.log(a[b]);

```

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### ‚ûº‚ûº‚ûº: 456

In this code, a is an empty object that is being assigned properties using the square bracket notation. The values of the properties are being set to the numbers 123 and 456. The keys of the properties are the objects b and c.

When the console.log statement is executed, it logs the value of the property of a whose key is the object b. In this case, the value of this property is 456, because the value of the property was last set to 456 when the object c was used as the key.

This behavior occurs because when objects are used as keys in an object, the object's default behavior is to convert the object to a string representation. In this case, both b and c are converted to the string [object Object], which means that they both end up being used as the same key in the a object. As a result, the value of the property that is set using the object c as the key overwrites the value of the property that was set using the object b as the key.

So the object a looks like -

```JS
{
    "[object Object]": 456
}
```

12. **What will be the output ?**

```JS
let obj1 = { key: "value" };
let obj2 = obj1;
let obj3 = obj2;

obj1.key = "new value";
obj2 = { key: "another value" };

console.log(obj1.key, obj2.key, obj3.key);

```

<br/>

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### ‚ûº‚ûº‚ûº:  `new value` `another value` `new value`

In this code, we are declaring three variables obj1, obj2, and obj3, and assigning an object to each of them. Then, we are reassigning a new object to obj2 and modifying a property of obj1.

When the console.log statement is executed, it logs the values of the key property for each object. The value of the key property for obj1 is "new value", the value of the key property for obj2 is "another value", and the value of the key property for obj3 is "new value".

This is because when an object is assigned to a variable, the variable stores a reference to the object in memory rather than the object itself. Changing the value of a property of the object using one variable will affect the value of that property when accessed using a different variable that references the same object. However, reassigning a new object to a variable will change the reference stored in that variable, so the original object is no longer accessible using that variable.

In this case, the value of the key property for obj1 was changed to "new value" using the obj1 variable, which affected the value of the key property when accessed using the obj3 variable, because both variables reference the same object. However, the value of the key property for obj2 was not affected, because the obj2 variable was reassigned to reference a new object.

13. **What will be the output ?**

```JS

const obj = {
  a: "foo",

c();

```

<br/>

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### ‚ûº‚ûº‚ûº: foo, undefined

When the method obj.b is called directly on obj, the output will be "foo". This is because this refers to the object that the method is called on, and obj.a is equal to "foo".

When the variable c is assigned the value of obj.b, it is a reference to the function itself and not the object obj. When c is called, it is not called on an object, so this will not refer to obj and the value of this.a is undefined. As a result, the output when calling c() will be undefined.

14. **What will be the output ?**

```JS
const x = { foo: 1 };
const y = { foo: 2 };

function addFoo(obj) {

console.log(addFoo(x));
console.log(addFoo(y));

```

<br/>

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### ‚ûº‚ûº‚ûº: 2,3

The addFoo function takes an object as an argument and returns the value of obj.foo + 1. When addFoo is called with x as the argument, the output will be 2, because x.foo is equal to 1. When addFoo is called with y as the argument, the output will be 3, because y.foo is equal to 2.

15. **What will be the output ?**

```JS
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(i);
  }, 1000);
}

```

<br/>

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### ‚ûº‚ûº‚ûº: 5, 5, 5, 5, 5

The setTimeout function is called inside of a loop that iterates through the elements in the arr array. The setTimeout function will execute its callback function after a delay of 1000 milliseconds. However, by the time the delay has elapsed and the callback function is called, the loop will have already completed and the value of i will be 5. As a result, the output will be 5 printed five times.
